# polysome-stats
Library of functions for polysome analysis with example jupyter notebooks.

Miniconda environment (env.yaml) can be installed with the command:

`conda env create -f env.yaml`

However, my advise is to first install mamba in your conda base environment because it speeds up environment solving greatly (https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html), after installing mamba you can just run:

`mamba env create -f env.yaml`
